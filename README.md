# Lead-Score-Case-Study
# Problem Approach and Analysis of the Data
X Education offers online courses to potential industry professionals. They get lots of leads from various
sources such as past referrals, several websites and search engine such as Google. After the lead is
identified the sales team will follow up with potential candidates and convert them as paying customers.
But due to high volumes of potential leads they want to efficiently follow only the Hot Leads instead of
all the leads. So our target should be to identify those hot leads which can be concentrated and
converted to a paying customer thus increasing the overall revenue.

# Analysis Approach:
To decide on the hot leads from the X education data provided. We will perform all the following
steps.
1. Read the data from the dataset provided.
2. We need to handle the Null values and outliers from the dataset.
3. Do some initial EDA for getting the insights of the data more.
4. Create dummy columns for categorical variables.
5. Feature scaling for continuous variables.
6. Divide the data into Train and Test sets.
7. Use the RFE to decide the variables based on RFE score and eliminating the features based on p
values and VIFs
8. Perform Model evaluation on Test data.
9. Perform Model Validation.
